# Brain-Drive by Daksh Malhotra
Description: 
    Brain Drive is an innovative application designed to store and organize your brain’s data—memories, important moments, and personal reflections. Users can log memories with text, images, or audio, write future notes to themselves, and securely store their thoughts in a memory vault. Advanced features include AI-generated visuals to bring memories to life, emotion tagging for organizing experiences, and a timeline or map view for revisiting life’s journey. With capabilities like erasing memories, setting memory capsules, and sharing experiences collaboratively, Brain Drive ensures a personalized, secure, and interactive way to preserve and reflect on your life.
